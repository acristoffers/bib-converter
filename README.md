# bib-converter

Converts between bibtex and biblatex by parsing whatever the input is and applying the conversions
to the output. It is not meant to be feature-packed, in reality it is meant to solve my problem
only, so some keys are dropped, the output is formatted the way I like it, date/time translation is
minimal and there is no sanitization as I always have a valid input file to start with. It is mostly
an private project made public so I can easily fetch it from Nix, but maybe it helps you too.
